<div id="daveBio">
With a career spanning four decades and over 100M album sales worldwide, award-winning singer, songwriter, musician, producer and Eurythmics co-founder Dave Stewart is among the most respected and accomplished talents in popular music history. Stewart co-wrote and produced each Eurythmics album in his world-famous duo with Annie Lennox. He has also produced albums and co-written songs with Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, Tom Petty, Gwen Stefani, Damian Marley, Stevie Nicks, Daryl Hall, Bryan Ferry, A.R. Rahman, Katy Perry, Sinead O'Connor, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, and Joss Stone, and many others.

His wide-ranging work has earned Stewart a long list of prestigious honors, including over fifty ASCAP and BMI Awards, four Ivor Novello Awards for <strong>"Best Songwriter,"</strong> four BRIT Awards for <strong>"Best Producer"</strong> (including a Lifetime Achievement Award), a Golden Globe Award, and a GRAMMY® Award. <strong>"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)"</strong> by Eurythmics was recently inducted into the GRAMMY Hall of Fame® and U.S. Library of Congress National Recording Registry, in recognition of its qualitative and historical significance. Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox were among the 2020 inductees into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, inducted by St. Vincent, with the ceremony taking place in 2022. Also in 2022, with an inspired induction by U2's The Edge, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation welcomed Eurythmics as inductees for their profound impact on music. At both monumental ceremonies, Eurythmics brought the house down with their stellar and transcendent performance. Since 2023 Dave has been touring 'Dave Stewart Eurythmics' featuring Vanessa Amorosi and a virtuoso all female band including dates in the US and Europe. Further dates in Europe are scheduled for July 2025. See davestewartent.com for details.

On April 12 Dave Stewart will release DAVE DOES DYLAN, a 14-song homage to Bob Dylan — who deemed Stewart <strong>"a dreamer and a fearless innovator."</strong> The album has had a limited-edition vinyl release for Record Store Day and will be available on all DSP's from July 18th 2025 via Surfdog Records. The spirit and sonic foundation of DAVE DOES DYLAN is built with live takes, pure and unedited. Featuring just Dave Stewart on vocals and guitars recorded in one take, the album finds him performing inspired renditions of Dylan's songs — all of which he has adored since an early age.

In 2022 Dave Stewart released Ebony McQueen, one of his most ambitious and autobiographical works of his remarkable life and landmark career; an exhilarating, original, semi-autobiographical musical fable about music and young manhood, finding hard-earned wisdom and true love with the girl next door. The acclaimed album was released last year and work on the film is due to begin shortly.

Dave is the owner/founder of Bay Street Records, writing and producing with unknown and legendary artists to release on this boutique record label.

<strong>"He is my hero."</strong> – Stevie Nicks

<strong>"I love Dave's passion for making music."</strong> – Mick Jagger

<strong>"He's the musician's musician."</strong> – Rolling Stone
